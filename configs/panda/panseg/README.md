NOTE: These detector models were trained on V2 of the PILArNet-M dataset, which is the one published
in the Panda paper. This is *not* the same as the PILArNet-M dataset which was published in the
PoLAr-MAE paper.

This is because the entire dataset had to be reprocessed for the Panda paper to include PID information.
This was done after the base models were pre-trained and semantic segmentation models trained.
